```shell
${EDITOR} sample_streak.csv
ruby generate_streak.rb sample_streak.csv chart.png
open chart.png
```

Or go read [generate_streak.rb](/generate_streak.rb) to see how you can generate charts with your own data.

If you're just going to use the `generate_streak.rb` script, just know that you can put whatever in your csvs as long as the last field is the date.
